This is a port of the fxload module from the linux-hotplug project
(http://linux-hotplug.sf.net) to Mac OSX. Instead of libusb it uses
native OSX USB primatives.

To build and [optionally] install to /usr/local/bin:

1. brew install xcodegen
2. make
3. make install

Successfuly tested on macOS 10.14.
