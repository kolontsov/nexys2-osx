This is a port of the fxload module from the linux-hotplug project
(http://linux-hotplug.sf.net) to Mac OSX. Instead of libusb it uses
native OSX USB primatives.

To install with Homebrew:

   brew tap kolontsov/fxload
   brew install fxload

To build and install manually:

   brew install xcodegen
   make && make install

Successfuly tested on macOS 10.14 with Cypress CY7C68013A (FX2LP)
